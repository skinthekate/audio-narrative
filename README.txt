Summary
This project will delve into the history of how female desire and sexuality have been explored and intertwined throughout horror films. By looking at various films from different eras both in society at large and within horror as a genre, a clear picture of the twoâ€™s relationship will be painted. In addition, a deeper look into how this relationship has evolved from the early days of horror to now will be dissected and used to analyze societal changes.
